## Task 4: Loan Default Risk with Business Cost Optimization

**Objective:**  
Predict the likelihood of loan default and optimize decision-making using cost-benefit analysis to minimize financial loss.

**Dataset:**  
Home Credit Default Risk Dataset – contains information about applicants, loans, and previous repayment behavior.

**Instructions / Approach:**  
1. **Clean and Preprocess the Dataset**  
   - Handle missing values using imputation.  
   - Scale numeric features and encode categorical variables.

2. **Train Binary Classification Models**  
   - Train models such as Logistic Regression and CatBoost.  
   - Optimize hyperparameters for better prediction accuracy.

3. **Define Business Cost Values**  
   - Assign financial costs for **False Positives (FP)** and **False Negatives (FN)**.  
   - FP: Approving a risky loan  
   - FN: Rejecting a safe applicant  

4. **Adjust Decision Threshold**  
   - Instead of default 0.5, adjust probability threshold to minimize total business cost.  
   - Evaluate using **confusion matrix, precision, recall, and total cost**.

**Skills Gained:**  
- Binary classification modeling for credit risk  
- Cost-based evaluation metrics  
- Risk modeling and scoring  
- Feature importance analysis
